### Compatibility

Master & eonasdan branches, tags v3.0.2+: Bootstrap 3+, Rails 4+ and SimpleForm 3.1.RC1+ (using https://github.com/eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker.git as submodule, well maintained repo). Any further development will be made on these branches.

Tag v3.0.1 and tarruda branch: Bootstrap 3+, Rails 4+ and SimpleForm 3.1.RC1+ (using an upgraded version of https://github.com/tarruda/bootstrap-datetimepicker.git as inline code, not maintained). No further development, only bug fix for fatal issues on this branch.

Tag v1.0.0: Rails 3.2, Bootstrap 2.3.2 & SimpleForm >= 2.0.4 - No further development, only bug fix for fatal issues on this branch.


### Dependency

Versions v3.1.1+ has a dependency on the moment.js version 2.8.1 javascript library (for details refer to: http://momentjs.com/) and the gem includes the dependency reference in its Gemfile (gem 'momentjs-rails', '>= 2.8.1',  :github => 'derekprior/momentjs-rails').

Versions v3.0.2 & v3.0.3 has a dependency on the moment.js version v2.7, but the gem **have not installed this library** out of the box, so **you have to look after that**. Put "gem 'momentjs-rails', '2.7',  :github => 'derekprior/momentjs-rails'" to your project Gemfile to install it.

### Credits and references

The project is based on: https://github.com/tarruda/bootstrap-datetimepicker.git project. It was upgraded to be compatible with Bootstrap 3+ and was refactored significantly by Eonasdan (see: https://github.com/eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker.git).

    gem 'datetimepicker-rails', git: 'git://github.com/zpaulovics/datetimepicker-rails', tag: 'v1.0.0'

then execute:

    $ bundle install


### Configuration

Add this line to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

``` css
 *= require bootstrap-datetimepicker
or
 *= require bootstrap-datetimepicker.min

```

Add this line to app/assets/javascripts/application.js

From version 3.0.2+:

```javascript
//= require moment
//= require bootstrap-datetimepicker
//= require pickers

// You may include any languages (optional)
//= require locales/bootstrap-datetimepicker.hu
```

Earlier version:

```javascript
//= require bootstrap-datetimepicker/core
//= require bootstrap-datetimepicker/pickers

// You may include any languages (optional)
//= require bootstrap-datetimepicker/locales/bootstrap-datetimepicker.hu
```


### Calling the generator

After you install 'datetimepicker' and add it to your Gemfile, you need to run the generator.
The generator will create the custom field definitions for Simple Form in your project. There are 3
custom field definitions. The generator look at the app/inputs directory of your project and create
only those custom field definitions that are not already exists in your project. If you have a custom
input with the same name the generator does not overwrite it.

At generation time the pickers.js and required asset files will be places in your assets pipeline,
that makes these files accessible for you out of the box.

The datetimepicker-rails is using the following custom field definitions:

    datetime_picker_input.rb    # for fields with :as => :datetime_picker
    date_picker_input.rb        # for fields with :as => :date_picker
    time_picker_input.rb        # for fields with :as => :time_picker


To run the generator use the following command:
```
   $ rails generate datetimepicker_rails:install
```
if you want to use the default Glyphicon icons for the pickers, or execute the following command
```
  $ rails generate datetimepicker_rails:install Font-Awesome
```
to use the Font-Awesome icons for the pickers.

The current version will copy the required files to your projects 'vendor/assets' directory
(not to the gem's vendor/assets directory as before). That makes it possible to tailor by your projects
the SimpleForm 'input' and the 'pickers.js' files to your needs at your own area. That gives you much more
flexibility to use your preferred options of the bootstrap-datetimepicker plugin.

All available language files will be copied to your vendor/assets/locales directory.

### Using datetimepicker-rails

Just call datetimepicker() with any selector.

#### HTML

```html
<input class="datetimepicker" type="text" >

<script type="text/javascript">
    $('.datetimepicker').datetimepicker();
</script>
```

#### Simple_Form

```html
<%= f.input :start_date_time, :as => :datetime_picker %>

<%= f.input :closing_date, :as => :date_picker %>

<%= f.input :begin-at, :as => :time_picker %>
```

The scripts below will be included, when you use the "require pickers" or "require bootstrap-datetimepicker/pickers". If you
need different activation scripts, ignore the //= require pickers or //= require bootstrap-datetimepicker/pickers line
(depending on your installation) in app/assets/javascripts/application.js.

```javascript
    $(document).on('ready page:change', function() {
        $('.datepicker').datetimepicker({
            pickTime: false
        });
    });

    $(document).on('ready page:change', function() {
        $('.datetimepicker').datetimepicker({
            pickSeconds: false
        });
    });

    $(document).on('ready page:change', function() {
        $('.timepicker').datetimepicker({
            pickDate: false,
            pickSeconds: false
        });
    });
```

### Date and time formating

Specify your intended date and time formats in your config/locales/en.yml or related language file as follows:

    en:
      datepicker:
        dformat: '%d/%m/%Y'        # display format of the date (this is the default, can be ommited)
        pformat: 'DD/MM/YYYY'      # picking format of the date (this is the default, can be ommited)
        weekstart: 0               # the week starts on Sunday (this is the default, can be ommited)
      timepicker:
        dformat: '%R'              # display format of the time (this is the default, can be ommited)
        pformat: 'HH:mm'           # picking format of the time (this is the default, can be ommited)

#### Notes for formating date/time:

* dformat is used to format any date value to put it to the html input tag value attribute.
The standard Ruby Time library 'strftime' method is used to make this date to string conversion.
For more details, please refer to the Ruby Built-in Classes and Modules documentation.
This should be applied for any version.

* pformat is the format, that used by the javastript library to format the date/time string submitted by a form.

1. pformat for current versions (3.0.2+): We have upgraded to the repository
of bootstrap-datetimepicker by Eonasdan as submodule, the new library is using the moment.js
(for more information see Moment's documentation [here](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).

2. pformat for earlier versions: Earlier versions are based on the bootstrap-datetimepicker
by @tarruda, which applies a different pattern to make the date to string conversion. He does
not released any documentation. Here is the related part of the source code:
```
    dd: {property: 'UTCDate', getPattern: function() { return '(0?[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1])\\b';}},
    MM: {property: 'UTCMonth', getPattern: function() {return '(0?[1-9]|1[0-2])\\b';}},
    yy: {property: 'UTCYear', getPattern: function() {return '(\\d{2})\\b'}},
    yyyy: {property: 'UTCFullYear', getPattern: function() {return '(\\d{4})\\b';}},
    hh: {property: 'UTCHours', getPattern: function() {return '(0?[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3])\\b';}},
    mm: {property: 'UTCMinutes', getPattern: function() {return '(0?[0-9]|[1-5][0-9])\\b';}},
    ss: {property: 'UTCSeconds', getPattern: function() {return '(0?[0-9]|[1-5][0-9])\\b';}},
    ms: {property: 'UTCMilliseconds', getPattern: function() {return '([0-9]{1,3})\\b';}},
    HH: {property: 'Hours12', getPattern: function() {return '(0?[1-9]|1[0-2])\\b';}},
    PP: {property: 'Period12', getPattern: function() {return '(AM|PM|am|pm|Am|aM|Pm|pM)\\b';}}
```
